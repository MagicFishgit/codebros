A full CRUD social media application using the MERN stack. - This is for learning purposes.

I am stashing this project for now. The resources I am using to help me build this is quite outdated
and I find I am battling legacy dependency issues more than actually learning the MERN stack. 
Will return to this project at a later time and redo it completely.

I have learned at least a lot about structuring and use of Mern, node and MongoDB.
